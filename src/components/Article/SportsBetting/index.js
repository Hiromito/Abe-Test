          Why Do People Bet On Sports??
        </Heading>
        <Paragraph>
          Betting makes watching sports more exciting, gives you something new to debate with friends and lets you prove your superior sports knowledge to the world.

          To begin, though, let’s direct our attention to a celebrity endorsement; a sports fan known as “Sandman.” In a <Link>2019 interview on NPR's Fresh Air</Link>, actor/comedian Adam Sandler described the sheer excitement of sports betting to host Terry Gross.

        <Paragraph>
          "When you bet on a game, [and] I do bet sometimes," Sandler said, "You watch so close when you have money on a game, and it means something to you. [But] it's not only the money. You made this decision in your head. You told everyone on the planet, this is going to happen." Sandler continued, "So you're watching the game with a different energy. And honest to God, when you make a bet on something and the game starts at 7:05, your body is shaking at two in the afternoon going, it's coming. It's coming. When you get to that actual game, there is so much excitement, you can't contain it."

          Sports Are A Unifying Force — And Betting Enhances The Experience
        </Heading>
        <Paragraph>
          Sports bring people together in a way that few other things can. It’s a pure form of mass entertainment that even helps in the real world!
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          When you have to network, sports can be a strong icebreaker that creates a meaningful connection and gets people talking about something they’re passionate about, as opposed to something work-related.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          That can be a nice, organic way in to an otherwise nerve-wracking or potentially awkward situation. Plus, with how widespread legal sports betting is becoming, it’ll only continue to develop in prominence in casual conversation.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Adding responsible betting to the mix of sports makes the stakes go way up and improves the viewing experience, as Mr. Sandler so eloquently put it. It can pique your interest in a game or match you’d otherwise pay little attention to — and can even be a profitable way to spend your time in the end. Even a minimal wager can get the blood and adrenaline flowing, and we’ll do our best to prepare you as well as possible to jump in on the fun and win more often than most.
